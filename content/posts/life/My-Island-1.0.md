### How to Visit My Island
Use DA code in the game: DA-3444-7211-0416

### Island Overview
ðŸ‘‰**Partly Inspired, Partly Original**: Images and DA code are for island building reference only and cannot be redistributed or used commercially  
ðŸ‘‰**Color Scheme & Style**: Warm tones with a European/Western countryside feel, mixed with small areas of Japanese and forest themes.  
ðŸ‘‰**Design Guidelines**: Use system tiles as much as possible. Avoid using simple wall panels for fake scenery.  
ðŸ‘‰**Connectivity**: Most areas are connected; if you can't find your way, try adjusting your perspective.  
ðŸ‘‰**House Interior**: All interiors of the main house are complete and open for visiting. The hot spring inn is a small house; the first floor is mostly done, but the other two floors are not yet finished.  

ðŸ¥³Finally, enjoy Your Visit!
